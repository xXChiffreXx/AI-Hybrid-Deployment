# Software Architecture Documentation

This folder contains implementation-oriented architecture docs derived from the current budget models and repository assumptions.

## Documents

- [`00_system_architecture.md`](00_system_architecture.md): system context, component boundaries, trust boundaries, and interfaces.
- [`01_runtime_routing_and_invocation.md`](01_runtime_routing_and_invocation.md): routing policy, execution flows, and proposed invocation contracts.
- [`02_deployment_and_operations.md`](02_deployment_and_operations.md): deployment topology, runtime controls, observability, and reliability operations.

## Scope Note

These documents define a software architecture baseline. The repository does not yet include the corresponding runtime implementation (gateway service, invocation scripts, or deployment manifests).
