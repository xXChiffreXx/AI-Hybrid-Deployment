# Architecture Option A: $2,500 Machine Budget

## Goal

Minimize upfront cost while keeping a usable team SSH node with 10Gb networking and predictable knowledge-base throughput.

## Target Infrastructure Profile

- 1 shared research node
- 10Gb Ethernet
- 12-16 CPU cores
- 64-96 GB RAM
- 2 TB NVMe SSD
- GPU or unified-memory profile sufficient for quantized local models
- SSH access for small team (3-6 users)

This design is OS-agnostic because serving standardizes on `llama-server` (OpenAI-compatible API).

## Logical Architecture

- `gateway` for routing and budget limits
- `llama-server` for local inference
- `redis` for semantic/prefix cache keys and job state
- `qdrant` for retrieval memory by sector
- `kb-writer` service writing canonical records to `SQLite + Parquet`
- `obsidian-projector` job generating optional vault views

## Deployment Pattern

- Single-node compose stack
- One local inference worker pool
- Cloud used for hard tasks and capacity overflow

## Memory-Constrained Operating Point

Assumptions for Track A generation profile:

- Installed memory envelope: $M_{avail} = 64 \text{ to } 96$ GB
- Safety factor: $\eta = 0.85$
- Usable memory envelope: $\eta M_{avail} = 54.4 \text{ to } 81.6$ GB
- Planned runtime working set (medium quantized model class): $M_{req} \approx 24 \text{ to } 40$ GB

Throughput decomposition:

- $\mu_{compute} \approx 125$ tokens/sec
- $\mu_{memory} \approx 90$ tokens/sec
- $f_{fit} = 1.00$

```math
\mu_{eff}=f_{fit}\cdot\min(\mu_{compute},\mu_{memory})=1.00\cdot 90=90
```

## Capacity Assumption

- Effective local capacity target: $\mu_{eff} = 90$ tokens/sec
- Per-source token load: $T_{in}+T_{out}=725{,}000$

Theoretical local-only source throughput:

```math
\text{sources/day} = \frac{\mu_{eff} \cdot 86400}{725000} \approx 10.73
```

## Cloud Cost Model (Instantiated)

Using the shared model in `00_cloud_cost_model.md`:

- Hard-task cloud fraction: $r_h = 0.20$
- Baseline peak demand: $\lambda_{peak}=44.75$ tokens/sec
- Stress peak demand: $\lambda_{peak}=80.56$ tokens/sec

Overflow fractions:

```math
r_{over,base} = \max\left(0,\frac{44.75-90}{44.75}\right)=0
```

```math
r_{over,stress} = \max\left(0,\frac{80.56-90}{80.56}\right)=0
```

Monthly cloud cost:

```math
C_{month}=S\left(r_hc_h+(1-r_h)r_{over}c_e\right)
```

For web-aware enrichment workflows, use the extended cost equation in `00_cloud_cost_model.md`:
$C_{month}^{web}$ with $h_{db}$, $p_{escalate}$, and $c_{fill}$.

with $c_e=0.33925$, $c_h=1.69625$.

Baseline (`S=40`):

```math
C_{base}=40\left(0.20\cdot1.69625+0.80\cdot0\cdot0.33925\right)=\$13.57/month
```

Stress (`S=72`):

```math
C_{stress}=72\left(0.20\cdot1.69625+0.80\cdot0\cdot0.33925\right)=\$24.43/month
```

Approximate annual cloud range from this model: `$163 - $293`.

## Test Deployment Snapshot Entries

Use one row per pilot snapshot window (recommended: 24h to 168h windows).

| Snapshot ID | Git Commit | Start (UTC) | End (UTC) | Model Profile | Context Tokens | Concurrency | Sources Completed | Tokens In | Tokens Out | Peak Arrival `lambda_peak_obs` (tok/s) | `mu_compute_obs` (tok/s) | `mu_memory_obs` (tok/s) | `f_fit_obs` | `mu_eff_obs` (tok/s) | `rho_obs` | `r_over_obs` | Peak Memory (GB) | `h_db_obs` | `local_time_budget_sec` | `p_escalate_obs` | `c_fill_obs` (USD/call) | `cloud_fill_calls_obs` | `avg_missing_fields_obs` | `local_cli_calls_obs` | Cloud Spend (USD) | `q_accept_obs` | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| snap-001 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Derived fields for this architecture:

```math
\mu_{eff,obs}=f_{fit,obs}\cdot\min(\mu_{compute,obs},\mu_{memory,obs})
```

```math
\rho_{obs}=\frac{\lambda_{peak,obs}}{\mu_{eff,obs}}, \quad r_{over,obs}=\max\left(0,\frac{\lambda_{peak,obs}-\mu_{eff,obs}}{\lambda_{peak,obs}}\right)
```

```math
N_{cloud\_calls,obs}=S_{obs}\left(0.20+0.80\left(r_{over,obs}+(1-r_{over,obs})(1-h_{db,obs})p_{escalate,obs}\right)\right)
```

```math
C_{month,obs}^{web}=S_{obs}\left(0.20\cdot c_h + 0.80\left(r_{over,obs}\cdot c_e + (1-r_{over,obs})(1-h_{db,obs})p_{escalate,obs}c_{fill,obs}\right)\right)
```

Model versus observed quick check:

| Metric | Model | Observed |
|---|---:|---:|
| `mu_eff` (tok/s) | `90` |  |
| `rho` at baseline | `0.50` |  |
| Cloud cost/month baseline (USD) | `13.57` |  |

## Fit for Project

### Pros

- Low hardware cost with materially better memory headroom than the `$599` class.
- Fastest to acquire and deploy.
- Works for pilot and steady moderate throughput.

### Constraints

- Cloud costs remain higher than `$5,000` and `$7,500` tiers because of a larger hard-route fraction.
- Less SLO headroom than higher tiers during burst windows.
- Limited room for large-context or high-concurrency local serving compared with higher budgets.

## Recommended If

Choose this if your priority is low capital expense with stable throughput at `40/month` and you accept less burst headroom than higher tiers.
