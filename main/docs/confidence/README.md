# Confidence and Uncertainty Documentation

This folder defines how to quantify output quality uncertainty for the MVP workflow.

It formalizes confidence intervals for acceptance and hallucination rates so quality gates can be applied consistently across pilot windows.

## Documents

- [`00_output_confidence_interval_method.md`](00_output_confidence_interval_method.md): formal CI definitions, equations, decision rules, and telemetry requirements.
- [`01_qwen_budget_hallucination_standard.md`](01_qwen_budget_hallucination_standard.md): budget-tier Qwen mapping and deployment-standard hallucination governance.
